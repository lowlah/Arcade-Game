# Arcade-Game
This is my repository for udacity's Arcade game project. Live version can be found here : https://lowlah.github.io/Arcade-Game/ . The game was developed to meet minimum requirements. Additional features like  game timing and levels will be added and the game will be updated.

## How to play the game
The goal of the game is for the player to avoid collisions with the bug and for the player to reach the water tile. The game is won when the player successfully reaches the water tile. A modal will be displayed. Use the 'up,down,left,right' arrow keys on the keyboard to move the player in a particular direction.
To run the game directly on your computer download from https://github.com/lowlah/Arcade-Game and open index.html file in your browser.
